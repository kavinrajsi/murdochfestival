                      <p>It's easy to see people at the top and wonder how the hell they got there. In this exclusive Sound On experience, you'll hear how our headline acts have changed the game in their fields – and how they did it. Guided by The Indigo Project, we'll hang out with our headliners, personalities and Murdoch alumni over an intimate chat where we'll get to know their stories and discover the strategies they’ve used to deal with life, exams and everything in between. Leave ready to chase down some life goals of your own.</p>
